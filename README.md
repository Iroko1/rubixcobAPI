# About
This api will create an almost perfect scramble string for a rubix cube

You will need to register with an email and an API Key will be provided to you so you can login

Once you login you can create requests with your API key and see past request or delete some

# setup
For development you will need to create and connect a database to this project

I use MariaDB with phpMyAdmin
